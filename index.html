        <p class="lead mb-4">Personally working in an elementary school as a tutor was one of the greatest experiences I have had so far. Not only does it allow me to help children learn who they are and become more comfortable within the classroom, but it also allows me work experience to become a counselor. Furthermore it allows me to keep building valuable and meaningful experiences with students to be able to understand the everyday challenges they face not only in schools but also socially. Moreover, it teaches oneself the art of being patient with not only the students but oneself. It makes you become more organized not only in your personal life but also in your work life. With this it helps you create more connections with those around you that are going to be working in the same industries as me. It opens the doors to really show and guide you to the job you want to pursue. Not only are you benefiting from being a tutor and helping kids understand and become more comfortable within themselves but youâ€™re also helping yourself become more confident in the classroom environment. <br><br>

       Being present in working with customer services which included working both in retail and in fast food restaurants. In retail customer services is portrayed through the way we treat the guest tso that is to say that we have to keep the store clean and presentable at all times. Not only that but if we are to work in the fitting rooms it is to ensure that our guests have the best experiences possible to have a good shopping experience. As a cashier the main priority is to accommodate the needs of the guest. That is done so by asking questions like if they have the right sizes, if they need help buying anything online, also accommodating prices, and answering tricky questions that they may have. 
<br><br>

        Working in fast food taught me so many things especially how to deal with customers and deescalate multiple situations that can get out of hand. Patience is key when dealing with customers and making sure that the customers are always happy regardless of the situation. Learning how to be selfless and put others' needs before your own is the main priority and that the customers leave with smiles on their faces and good memories of the place. As a cashier in fast food the main priority is to keep a smile on your face and to be kind and efficient with your time as to make sure that the customers are getting their food in a timely manner. Maintaining the orders they are coming in organized while also at the same time making sure all the orders are complete to leave the customers accommodations. Additionally it is important to always work together as a team to be able to finish the tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible as that is what will make the job so much easier and will make the experience for the customers memorable.
